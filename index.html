        <p>Ello! This is Pizzaleader. I'm a guy who loves to tinker, whether it be phones from 2012 or a motion detector from Kano.

I'm a moderator of a couple discord servers. The main server I'm an admin (now owner!!!) is the Minecraft 3ds server. It has over 1000 members. I also moderate in the Jmashtv discord, which is a place where people get help 100% completing Pokemon home. I moderate in other servers, and those will be linked below. Some of the games I enjoy are Minecraft and all it's versions, Kirby, Pokemon, Zelda, drive ahead, and geometry dash. Besides gaming, I program some python, not much, but I can make some low level games. I created sunny warfare, a simple game about shooting a sun. This game will be completely revamped when I'm not busy, so keep an eye on that. I also own a youtube channel, where I have a series about playing every version of Minecraft with other people. 

I dislike brainrot, and I prefer not to talk about politics. I am developing a Minecraft mod, although like sunny warfare, development has paused as I am extremely busy.

Anyways, I believe that's most of it, check out my other pages for more details!</p>
